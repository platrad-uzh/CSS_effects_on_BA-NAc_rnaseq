# Chronic social stress reductions of specific reward behaviours are replicated by either inhibition or activation of BA-NAc glutamate neurons

This repo contains the code and R Markdown files that accompany the paper by Madur L., Ineichen C, *et al.*. These scripts were used to process and analyse the transcriptomics datasets produced for the study.

This work was conducted by the [Preclinical Lab for Translational Research into Affective Disorders (PLATRAD)](https://www.dppp.uzh.ch/en/researchgroups/researchgroups/preclinicallab.html) led by Prof. Christopher R. Pryce in collaboration with scientists from the University of Zurich, the Psychiatric University Hospital ZÃ¼rich, ETH Zurich and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG.

The repo is divided in two parts, as two independent RNA-seq datasets were generted for the study.
